            <h2>Why Stirling?</h2>
<h3>Stirling - the Gateway to the Highlands</h3>

<p>Stirling used to be the capital of Scotland! The title was shared with Edinburgh for a time until the early 1600s, when
Edinburgh took the title solely.
The city is located in central Scotland: it is 26 miles northeast of Glasgow, and 37 miles northwest of Edinburgh.
Stirling has a population of 38,000 people and there are 14,000 students at the university.
The Old Stirling Bridge, which used to be the main access point across the River Forth was built around 1500.</p>
<p>
As part of Queen Elizabeth II’s Golden Jubilee in 2002, Stirling was granted city status. This makes Stirling the
youngest city in Scotland.
It is quite unclear what the origins are for the name Stirling, however, many have suggested that it derives from an old
Gaelic or Scots word that means ‘place of battle and struggle’.

            <p>Hi, my name is Judith and I did my master's degree in Stirling. I am still very fond of the town and the
                incredibly beautiful nature surrounding it. I created this website as part of SheCodes Responsive to practise
                my
                coding skills.
