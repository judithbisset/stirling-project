<h2>Why Stirling?</h2>
<h3>Stirling - the Gateway to the Highlands</h3>
<img class="wallace" src="../images/wallace-monument.JPG" alt="wallace-monument">
<p>Stirling used to be the capital of Scotland! The title was shared with Edinburgh for a time until the early 1600s, when
Edinburgh took the title solely.
The city is located in central Scotland: it is 26 miles northeast of Glasgow, and 37 miles northwest of Edinburgh.
Stirling has a population of 38,000 people and there are 14,000 students at the university.
The Old Stirling Bridge, which used to be the main access point across the River Forth was built around 1500.</p>
<p>Stirling was originally a Stone-Age settlement. In 1879, a stone cist (an ancient form of a grave) was found, which
dates back to over 2000 BC! There was a skeleton found inside the cist, which has been nicknamed Torbrex Tam, and carbon
dating suggests that he died in his 20s over four thousand years ago.
During the wars of Scottish Independence, many battles were fought in Stirling by the likes of William Wallace and
Robert the Bruce.
As part of Queen Elizabeth II’s Golden Jubilee in 2002, Stirling was granted city status. This makes Stirling the
youngest city in Scotland.
It is quite unclear what the origins are for the name Stirling, however, many have suggested that it derives from an old
Gaelic or Scots word that means ‘place of battle and struggle’.
